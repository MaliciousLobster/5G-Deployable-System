	Allocate 50gb of disk space to the VM. You'll need this much space for installing UHD, GNU, and their dependencies.
	Allocate as many CPU cores and as much RAM without compromising the host computer's performance. The SDRs and GNU require a lot of resources.
4. Start your Linux VM
5. In your linux VM, download all the dependencies required for the SDR to work with USRP, UHD, GNU, RFNoc, etc
	Install perl by opening the terminal (shortcut for opening the terminal: ctrl + alt + t), and typing "sudo apt install perl"
	Download this script.
